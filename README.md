## Description

Patterns and trends that machine learning models identify in large datasets, or ‘Big Data’, are taken as sources of truth and reason in recruitment and admission processes, measures taken in handling the pandemic, as well as in individual decisions to purchase an item. In current state of the art machine learning models (GANs, diffusion models), the way patterns are identified is inseparable from the datasets used to analyze data, because models are based on statistics. Nevertheless, we have very limited access to examine the processes and sources that inform such decisions.  

This workshop proposes a practice in reading and organizing digital information. We offer visual and programmatic techniques for inspecting relationships in the data and remaining open towards the relationships in data, to interpretability of statistics and data clusters. The course addresses the need to envision different ways of working with data and computational modeling. Together with the students, we will think about possible critical approaches to dataset analysis and visualization. With this, we hope to contribute a clear example for working with large dataset and machine learning technologies in ways that promote participation, intentionality, and critical thinking. 

## Learning objectives

Prior to using a dataset, we need to understand what kind of data are included and how the dataset is structured. With this, we can better understand what kinds of questions we can ask, and what kinds of conclusions we can draw. Still, it is only by doing In this course, we will work in small groups on processing datasets, on ways to access their architecture (structure) and rapid representation techniques that offer an overview of patterns, regularities and exceptions. After a short introduction into the programming language Python, we will look how publicly available data can be imported and parsed into a specific project. By applying data sciences techniques we will have a fresh look onto these datasets. Finally, we will consider how artists and designers create new narratives of environmental activism, protection and preservation using data related to different sensing projects, from bird observations to YouTube advertisement. No prior knowledge of programming is necessary.
